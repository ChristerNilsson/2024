Why are these 116 games even played, when they are so predictable?

## Highest rated players did not play at all

The two highest rated player, 2416 and 2413, never met in Swiss. With Elo Pairings, they would meet in the first round.

## Lowest rated players met in the eight round, the last.

The two lowest rated players, 1406 and 1417, actually met each other, but not the other six closest players.
